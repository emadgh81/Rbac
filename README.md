RBAC App

A robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) API built using NestJS, TypeScript, and MySQL.
This project provides a full system to manage Users, Roles, and Permissions with JWT authentication and role/permission-based authorization.

The architecture is modular and organized, making the code easy to read, maintain, and extend.

You can create users, assign roles, manage permissions, and enforce access control on API endpoints.
